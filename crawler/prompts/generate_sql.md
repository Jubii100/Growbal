# Task

You will receive HTML webpage content. Extract the following details exactly:

- Service description, rating, pricing.
- Provider type (has to be either Company or Agent), Country (has to be one of ('UAE', 'UK', 'USA')), name, logo (logo link), website, linkedin, facebook, instagram, telephone, mobile, emails, office locations, key individuals.
- Service provider member details: name, role_description, telephone, mobile, email, linkedin, facebook, instagram, twitter, additional_info.

Assume the PostgreSQL tables (`services_service`, `accounts_serviceproviderprofile`, `staffaccounts_serviceprovidermemberprofile`) are already created with the given schema:

{sql_schema}


Do NOT include any CREATE TABLE commands. Assume `service_id` and `user_id` are SERIAL PRIMARY KEYS, retrieved using RETURNING clauses in PostgreSQL.

Provide exactly ONE executable PostgreSQL transaction (wrapped in BEGIN; ... COMMIT;) containing only valid INSERT commands, precisely formatted and ready to run through a Python script executing SQL commands. No additional explanations or formatting outside the SQL code.

HTML Content:

{html_content}

# Output

Executable PostgreSQL transaction (wrapped in BEGIN; ... COMMIT;) containing only valid INSERT commands.
