# Onboarding Workflow - Debugging Setup Summary

## What Was the Issue?

The original workflow was getting stuck during the research phase due to:

1. **API Authentication Issues**: The research engine was failing to authenticate with web search APIs
2. **Research Blocking Flow**: The workflow was designed to do research first before asking questions
3. **No Interactive Input**: The original code simulated user responses instead of waiting for real input

## What Has Been Fixed/Added

### 1. **Verbose Logging & Debugging**
- Enabled LangChain verbose mode (`LANGCHAIN_VERBOSE=true`)
- Added Python DEBUG logging with timestamps
- Added debug output in all workflow nodes

### 2. **Interactive Input System**
Two input helpers created:
- **Advanced**: Uses Jupyter widgets (buttons, text areas)
- **Simple**: Uses standard Python `input()` function (more reliable)

### 3. **Workflow Modifications**
- Modified `research_decision_node` to skip research during testing
- Enhanced error handling in research phases
- Added fallback mechanisms when APIs fail

### 4. **Testing Tools**
- **Quick Interactive Test**: Bypasses research, goes straight to questions
- **Component Tests**: Test checklist generation, research engine, graph navigation individually
- **State Inspector**: Debug tool to examine workflow state at any point

## How the Interactive Input Works

### Method 1: Simple Input (Recommended)
```python
# When a question is asked, you'll see:
============================================================
ASSISTANT MESSAGE:
------------------------------------------------------------
What is your legal business name as shown on your UAE trade license?
------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR RESPONSE (or 'skip' to use default, 'debug' to toggle debug mode):
>>> 
```

**You type your response here** and press Enter.

### Method 2: Jupyter Widgets (Advanced)
- Text area box appears with Submit/Skip buttons
- Type response in the box and click Submit
- Click Skip to use default response

## How to Test the Workflow

### Quick Test (Recommended)
Run the cell labeled "Quick Interactive Test" which:
1. Skips research phases (avoiding API issues)
2. Directly asks 3 questions interactively
3. Shows conversation history
4. Works entirely offline

### Full Workflow Test
Run the "Interactive Onboarding Workflow" cell which:
1. Goes through the complete workflow
2. Includes research phases (may fail due to API keys)
3. Asks questions when research completes/fails
4. More comprehensive but may get stuck on research

## Debugging Tools Available

### 1. State Inspector
```python
inspect_state()  # Shows current workflow state
```

### 2. Component Tests
- Test checklist generation alone
- Test research engine components  
- Test graph navigation
- Each can be run independently

### 3. Verbose Output
- Every step shows debug information
- LangChain operations are logged
- User interactions are tracked

## Current Workflow Modifications for Testing

1. **Research Decision**: Modified to skip research and go directly to questions
2. **Error Handling**: Added try/catch blocks around API calls
3. **Fallback Questions**: If LLM question generation fails, use simple fallback
4. **Input Validation**: Handle cases where user input fails

## Next Steps for Production

To re-enable full functionality:
1. Set up proper API keys for web search
2. Restore original research decision logic in `workflow_agent.py`
3. Configure LangSmith tracing credentials
4. Test research phases with valid API access

## Key Files Modified

1. **`onboarding_0.ipynb`**: Added interactive cells and debug tools
2. **`workflow_agent.py`**: Modified research decision and added debug output
3. **Created debug helpers**: Interactive input classes for testing

The system is now ready for manual testing and debugging with full visibility into each step of the agent process!
